### 1\. Two Parallel, Separate Branches of Literature

For decades, the field was largely split.

* **Branch A: Heterogeneous Agent (HA) Models:** This field began with "seminal" papers like **Krusell and Smith (1998)**. These models were computationally complex and focused on inequality and heterogeneity. To make them solvable, researchers almost always used **"linear approximations of the aggregate dynamics"**. This branch eventually led to what we now call **Linearized HANK models**, which became popular for *estimation*.
* **Branch B: Nonlinear Representative Agent (RANK) Models:** This field used the simpler "representative agent" assumption. Because these models were less complex, researchers *could* solve them "globally" (nonlinearly). This became extremely important for studying "nonlinear aggregate dynamics" like the **zero lower bound (ZLB)**.

### 2\. The Recent "Fusion" (Nonlinear HANK)

The key challenge, which this paper addresses, is that the *interaction* between heterogeneity (from Branch A) and aggregate nonlinearities (from Branch B) is crucial.

* The **"Nonlinear HANK" model** is a recent attempt to merge these two branches: to build a model with *both* agent heterogeneity *and* aggregate nonlinearities (like the ZLB).
* The paper's authors argue that *solving* these models globally has only "recently been developed".
* This paper's primary contribution is to go one step further: they claim to be the **"first to estimate a HANK model in its nonlinear specification"**, moving beyond just *solving* it.

### Summary

The paper's validation progression (Linear-RANK $\rightarrow$ Nonlinear-RANK $\rightarrow$ Nonlinear-HANK) is a **pedagogical choice** to build trust in their new method. It starts with a simple, known case (Linear-RANK) and progressively adds the two layers of complexity (Nonlinearity, then Heterogeneity) that their method is designed to handle.

The *actual* history of the literature was messier:

1. **Nonlinear HA models** (like Krusell & Smith) and **Linearized RANK** models were developed.
2. These evolved into **Nonlinear-RANK** (to study the ZLB) and **Linearized-HANK** (to study heterogeneity in a simpler way).
3. Only very recently have researchers, including these authors, begun to successfully solve and estimate **Nonlinear-HANK** models, finally combining both frontiers.

This video from the authors of "Monetary Policy According to HANK" (a paper cited by KMR-2025) discusses the transmission mechanisms in HANK models, which are central to this paper's topic.

This video provides an overview of what HANK models are and why they are considered a new paradigm, replacing older RANK models for policy analysis.
