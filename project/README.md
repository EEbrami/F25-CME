# Mid-term Project

**Due Date**: TBD  
**Points**: 25% of final grade

## Project Overview

The mid-term project allows you to apply computational methods to a real economic problem. You will choose from a set of pre-approved topics or propose your own research question.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply multiple computational techniques to solve an economic problem
- Conduct independent research using computational tools
- Present results clearly and effectively
- Write well-documented, reproducible code

## Project Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Use at least two programming languages (MATLAB, Python, or Julia)
- Implement at least three different computational methods
- Include data analysis and visualization
- Code must be well-documented and reproducible

### Deliverables
1. **Project Proposal** (Due Week 6)
   - 2-page research proposal
   - Literature review (5-10 sources)
   - Methodology description

2. **Final Report** (Due Week 10)
   - 10-15 page technical report
   - Introduction and literature review
   - Methodology and implementation
   - Results and analysis
   - Conclusion and discussion

3. **Code Repository**
   - All source code with documentation
   - Data files (or instructions to obtain data)
   - README with reproduction instructions

4. **Presentation** (Week 11)
   - 15-minute presentation
   - 5 minutes for questions

## Suggested Topics

1. **Macroeconomic Modeling**
   - Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models
   - Business cycle analysis
   - Monetary policy evaluation

2. **Microeconomic Applications**
   - Consumer choice optimization
   - Firm production decisions
   - Market equilibrium analysis

3. **Econometric Analysis**
   - Causal inference methods
   - Time series forecasting
   - Panel data analysis

4. **Financial Economics**
   - Portfolio optimization
   - Risk management
   - Derivatives pricing

5. **Labor Economics**
   - Job search models
   - Human capital investment
   - Wage determination
