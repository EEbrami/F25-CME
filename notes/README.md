## Note-Taking Guidelines

- **Be Active**: Don't just copy slides, add your own insights
- **Use Examples**: Write down specific examples that help clarify concepts
- **Code Comments**: Annotate code examples with your understanding
- **Connect Ideas**: Link new concepts to previous material
- **Ask Questions**: Note questions to ask in office hours
