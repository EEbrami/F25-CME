# Project Overview: Problem Set 1

This problem set builds proficiency in function approximation, a foundational technique in computational economics.

## Problem 1: Interpolation Methods Benchmark

This problem benchmarks 2D function approximation methods (Chebyshev, Ordinary Polynomials, Splines) using the Franke function.

## Problem 2: Application to a Dynamic Economic Model

This problem applies these approximation techniques to solve the standard neoclassical stochastic growth model, modifying a baseline Euler equation solution method to improve its accuracy.
