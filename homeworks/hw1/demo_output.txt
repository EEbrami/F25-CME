=== Problem Set 1: Economic Model Application ===

--- Running Problem 2: Growth Model Solution ---
Running baseline growth model solver...
WARNING: This is a placeholder implementation.
The actual solve_growth_model_baseline function needs to be
implemented based on EGM_policy_iteration.m from the source repository.

Key implementation tasks:
1. Set up capital and productivity grids
2. Discretize productivity process using Tauchen method
3. Initialize policy function coefficients
4. Implement main iteration loop:
   - Compute expected values using Gauss-Hermite quadrature
   - Update policy function via ordinary polynomial regression
   - Check convergence
5. Compute Euler equation residuals on simulation

Returning placeholder results. Implement actual algorithm for meaningful results.
Baseline method complete.
Policy function grid: 50 capital points, 7 productivity states
Baseline implementation is placeholder - no meaningful errors computed.

--- Implementation Plan for Enhanced Methods ---
1. CHEBYSHEV METHOD:
   - Replace uniform grid with Chebyshev nodes
   - Use 2D Chebyshev regression instead of ordinary polynomial
   - Apply cheb_eval_2d() for policy function evaluation

2. SPLINE METHOD:
   - Keep uniform grid structure
   - Replace polynomial regression with griddedInterpolant
   - Update policy function as spline object in each iteration

3. ACCURACY COMPARISON:
   - Run all three methods to convergence
   - Compute Euler equation residuals on long simulation
   - Create comparison table of mean and max absolute residuals

Running enhanced methods (placeholder implementations)...
  Chebyshev method: Placeholder implementation
  Chebyshev method: Returning placeholder results
  Spline method: Placeholder implementation

--- Results Summary ---

Method Comparison (Euler Equation Residuals):
Method               Mean |Error|      Max |Error|
------               -----------      ----------
Baseline (Ord. Poly) N/A (placeholder) N/A (placeholder)
Chebyshev            N/A (placeholder) N/A (placeholder)
Spline               N/A (placeholder) N/A (placeholder)

No actual results to plot - all methods return placeholder values.

=== IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES ===
To complete Problem 2, you need to:

1. OBTAIN BASELINE CODE:
   - Get EGM_policy_iteration.m from CLMMJuliaPythonMatlab repository
   - Adapt it to work as solve_growth_model_baseline.m
   [... detailed implementation instructions ...]

Problem 2 framework complete. Implement actual solvers for meaningful results.
