## Problem 3(d): Accuracy Assessment and Solution Analysis

The comparative results demonstrate that numerical stability is the dominant factor in solving the Euler equation fixed-point problem, confirming the necessity of deterministic quadrature over fragile adaptive or noisy stochastic methods.

### 1. Superior Performance: Monomial Rules (P3c)

The Monomial Rules (M1 and M2) provided the most successful and stable solution path.

* Speed and Stability: Both rules converged to the final fixed point in an identical 936 iterations, approximately five times faster than the Monte Carlo method (5,000 iterations).
* Accuracy (Economic Plausibility): They identified the same non-trivial policy (\( \mathbf{k}' \approx 0.985 \) mean capital) with coefficients exhibiting the expected economic behavior, such as strong dependence on the productivity shock \( \mathbf{z} \).
* Numerical Robustness: Their fixed nodes navigated the iteration without encountering catastrophic `NaN` or singularity issues, confirming their stability in ill-conditioned problems.

### 2. Failure of Adaptive and Stochastic Methods

The experiment highlights the breakdown of methods relying on adaptive refinement or stochastic sampling:

| Method | Convergence Status | Implication |
|--------|--------------------|-------------|
| GH Quadrature (Qn=5) | Failed (NaNs) | Numerically Fragile: The fixed GHQ nodes encountered a point where the policy choice caused consumption \( c' \leq 0 \), resulting in numerical overflow and corrupted coefficients. This indicates that even GHQ requires stronger regularization to ensure robustness. |
| MATLAB `quad` | Failed (5,000 iterations, Max Error) | Computational Instability: The `quad` function, using Adaptive Simpson's rule, repeatedly encountered the integrand's near-singularity, leading to internal failure, premature termination, and a non-converged `NaN` policy. |
| MATLAB `integral` | Converged to Wrong Fixed Point (111 iterations) | Economically Invalid: While robust enough to avoid crashing, it converged to a trivial numerical solution (\( \mathbf{k}' \approx 0 \)). This policy is economically meaningless, demonstrating the solver's vulnerability to incorrect solutions when the policy path is unstable early on. |
| Monte Carlo (T=10) | Failed to Converge (5,000 iterations) | Inefficient and Noisy: This method failed to meet the convergence tolerance due to the high variance of \( T=10 \) random draws, introducing excessive noise into the \( \mathbf{k}'_{\text{new}} \) target vector, validating Judd et al.'s critique that crude Monte Carlo is unsuitable for high-accuracy policy iteration. |

### Conclusion

The accuracy of the solution is best ensured by the Monomial Rules (M1 and M2). These methods uniquely provided a non-trivial, economically plausible policy that converged to the desired tolerance in an efficient number of iterations. Their stability contrasts sharply with the numerical collapses observed in the GHQ and `quad` methods and the inefficiency of the Monte Carlo approach.
