# Homework Assignments

This directory contains all homework assignments for the course. Each assignment is organized in its own folder (HW1, HW2, etc.).

## Assignment Structure

Each homework folder typically contains:
- **Problem Statement**: PDF file with assignment description
- **Template Files**: Starter code in MATLAB (.m), Python (.py), and/or Julia (.jl)
- **Data Files**: Any datasets required for the assignment
- **README.md**: Specific instructions and submission guidelines

## Submission Guidelines

1. Complete all assigned problems
2. Include well-commented code
3. Provide written explanations where requested
4. Submit via the designated platform by the due date
5. Follow naming conventions: `lastname_firstname_HWx`
