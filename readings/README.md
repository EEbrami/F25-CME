## Reading Guidelines

### Effective Reading Strategies
1. **Pre-read**: Skim chapter/paper before lecture
2. **Active Reading**: Take notes, work through examples
3. **Post-lecture**: Re-read with deeper understanding
4. **Practice**: Implement methods and examples in code

### Paper Discussion Format
- **Summary**: Main contribution and methods (2-3 sentences)
- **Strengths**: What works well? Novel contributions?
- **Limitations**: Assumptions, computational constraints
- **Applications**: How could you use these methods?
- **Code**: Can you replicate key results?
