# Final Project

**Due Date**: End of Semester  
**Points**: 25% of final grade

## Project Overview

The final project is the capstone experience for this course. You will conduct an independent research project that demonstrates mastery of computational methods in economics. This project should be of publishable quality and showcase your ability to apply advanced computational techniques to original economic research.

## Learning Objectives

- Conduct original economic research using computational methods
- Demonstrate mastery of multiple programming languages and techniques

- Novel application of existing methods
- Implementation of cutting-edge techniques
- Large-scale data analysis
- Method development or extension
- Replication and extension of published research

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Use all three programming languages (MATLAB, Python, Julia) or provide strong justification for focusing on fewer
